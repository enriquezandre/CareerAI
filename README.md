# SampleMLNetApp

This guide will help you set up and run the SampleMLNetApp on your local machine.

## Prerequisites
Before you start, ensure you have NodeJS installed on your system. If you don't have it installed, please visit the official [NodeJS website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to download and install the latest stable version.

## Project Setup

### 1. Run WebAPI

Start by running the webAPI on your machine. Once the webAPI is running, you can access the Swagger UI by visiting the following link in your preferred web browser:

https://localhost:62573/swagger/index.html


### 2. Setting Up the React Application

Navigate to the `ml-net-app` folder in your file system. Open this folder in Visual Studio Code, or your preferred code editor.

Once inside the project folder, you'll need to install the required dependencies for the React application. To do this, run the following command in your terminal:

npm install

then:

npm start

it will then open in http://localhost:3000/

## Operation

For optimal operation and results, ensure both the Swagger UI and the React application are running simultaneously.

Thank you.
